Semester-3 Project @ JIIT

This repository is based on my college project and it's soul purpose is to save data to a secure place in order to avoid any losses and have easy backup.

The basic function of this project is to act as a source of information, for voters about the Lok Sabha Elections(India). The user can also rate the candidates contesting the elections which will give a general idea about the election results.
